# Black Cat Sound System

This project was completed in a timeframe of one month while working with a client to create a simple and beautiful looking responsive website for a sound system business. It is equipped with a contact form, about us page, and information about services provided. 

## How to use

- You can scroll through the page that has seperate sections with valuable information about the business.
- If you wish to send a message to the business owners you can fill out the form with your name, email address, and message then hit send and view an alert on whether the message was sent successfully or if there was an error.
- Once the message is sent you should receive a confirmation email detailing that the message was received.
- You can navigate using the navbar which will scroll to the different sections of the page or the collapsed navbar by clicking on the hamburger menu.


## Libraries

- Built with React, Javascript, and CSS.
- Emailjs for the email funcitonality.
- Material-ui to use cards used in the services page.
- Animate on scroll to create animations with information on the page fading in as the user scrolls through.
- React toastify to send the user an alert once a message is sent so that the user is aware where there was an error or whether it was sent successfully.
- react-router-hash-link used to create a scrolling effect when clicking on navbar links to view seperate sections of the website.
- Deployed using Netlify
